# Entry script to allow docker to be ran for bash, tests and docs.
# The script assumes a code repository can be mounted to ``/code`` and an output directory to ``/output``.
# Executes ``mode`` on ``branch`` or the provided ``code`` directory.
# $1: Mode, optional. Options:
#        - test: execute unit tests
#        - doc: build documentation, requires a mounted ``output`` directory if built from a branch.
#        - if not provided: execute bash.
# $2: Branch, optional.
#        Mutually exclusive with mounting a ``code`` directory.
#        Can be a branch on a Github fork, specified with the USERNAME#BRANCH format.
#        The test or doc build is executed on this branch.
