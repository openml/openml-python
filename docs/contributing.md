# Contributing

Contribution to the OpenML package is highly appreciated in all forms.
In particular, a few ways to contribute to openml-python are:

-   A direct contribution to the package, by means of improving the
    code, documentation or examples. To get started, see [this
    file](https://github.com/openml/openml-python/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)
    with details on how to set up your environment to develop for
    openml-python.
-   A contribution to an openml-python extension. An extension package
    allows OpenML to interface with a machine learning package (such
    as scikit-learn or keras). These extensions are hosted in separate
    repositories and may have their own guidelines. For more
    information, see also [extensions](extensions.md).
-   Bug reports. If something doesn't work for you or is cumbersome,
    please open a new issue to let us know about the problem.
-   [Cite OpenML](https://www.openml.org/cite) if you use it in a
    scientific publication.
-   Visit one of our [hackathons](https://www.openml.org/meet).
-   Contribute to another OpenML project, such as [the main OpenML
    project](https://github.com/openml/OpenML/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).
