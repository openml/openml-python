============

Contribution to the OpenML package is highly appreciated in all forms.
In particular, a few ways to contribute to openml-python are:

 * A direct contribution to the package, by means of improving the
   code, documentation or examples. To get started, see `this file <https://github.com/openml/openml-python/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md>`_
   with details on how to set up your environment to develop for openml-python.

 * A contribution to an openml-python extension. An extension package allows OpenML to interface
   with a machine learning package (such as scikit-learn or keras). These extensions
   are hosted in separate repositories and may have their own guidelines.
   For more information, see the :ref:`extensions` below.

 * Bug reports. If something doesn't work for you or is cumbersome, please open a new issue to let
   us know about the problem. See `this section <https://github.com/openml/openml-python/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md>`_.

 * `Cite OpenML <https://www.openml.org/cite>`_ if you use it in a scientific publication.

 * Visit one of our `hackathons <https://www.openml.org/meet>`_.

 * Contribute to another OpenML project, such as `the main OpenML project <https://github.com/openml/OpenML/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md>`_.
