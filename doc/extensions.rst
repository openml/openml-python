Extensions
==========

OpenML-Python provides an extension interface to connect other machine learning libraries than
scikit-learn to OpenML. Please check the :ref:`api_extensions` and use the
scikit-learn extension in :class:`openml.extensions.sklearn.SklearnExtension` as a starting point.

List of extensions
==================

Here is a list of currently maintained OpenML extensions:

* :class:`openml.extensions.sklearn.SklearnExtension`
* `openml-keras <https://github.com/openml/openml-keras>`_
* `openml-pytorch <https://github.com/openml/openml-pytorch>`_
* `openml-tensorflow (for tensorflow 2+) <https://github.com/openml/openml-tensorflow>`_


Connecting new machine learning libraries
=========================================

Content of the Library
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To leverage support from the community and to tap in the potential of OpenML,
interfacing with popular machine learning libraries is essential.
The OpenML-Python package is capable of downloading meta-data and results (data,
flows, runs), regardless of the library that was used to upload it.
However, uploading flows and runs from a specific library, requires an
additional interface.
The OpenML-Python team does not have the capacity to develop and maintain such
interfaces on its own. For this, we
have built an extension interface to allows others to contribute back. Building a suitable
extension for therefore requires an understanding of the current OpenML-Python support.

The :ref:`sphx_glr_examples_20_basic_simple_flows_and_runs_tutorial.py` tutorial
shows how scikit-learn currently works with OpenML-Python as an extension. The *sklearn*
extension packaged with the `openml-python <https://github.com/openml/openml-python>`_
repository can be used as a template/benchmark to build the new extension.


API
+++
* The extension scripts must import the `openml` package and be able to interface with
  any function from the OpenML-Python :ref:`api`.
* The extension has to be defined as a Python class and must inherit from
  :class:`openml.extensions.Extension`.
* This class needs to have all the functions from `class Extension` overloaded as required.
* The redefined functions should have adequate and appropriate docstrings. The
  `Sklearn Extension API :class:`openml.extensions.sklearn.SklearnExtension.html`
  is a good example to follow.


Interfacing with OpenML-Python
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Once the new extension class has been defined, the openml-python module to
:meth:`openml.extensions.register_extension` must be called to allow OpenML-Python to
interface the new extension.

The following methods should get implemented. Although the documentation in
the `Extension` interface should always be leading, here we list some additional
information and best practices. 
The `Sklearn Extension API :class:`openml.extensions.sklearn.SklearnExtension.html`
is a good example to follow. Note that most of the methods to be implemented 
are relatively simple, and can be done in several lines of code. 

* General setup (required)
  * :meth:`can_handle_flow`: Takes as argument an OpenML flow, and checks
    whether this can be handled by the current extension. The OpenML database
    consists of many flows, from various workbenches (e.g., scikit-learn, Weka,
    mlr). This method is called before a model is being deserialized.
    Typically, the flow-dependency field is used to check whether the specific
    library is present, and no unknown libraries are present there. 
  * :meth:`can_handle_model`: Similar as :meth:`can_handle_flow`, except that
    in this case a Python object is given. As such, in many cases, this method
    can be implemented by checking whether this adheres to a certain base class.
* Serialization and De-serialization (required)
  * :meth:`flow_to_model`: deserializes the OpenML Flow into a model (if the
    library can indeed handle the flow). This method has an important interplay
    with :meth:`model_to_flow`. 
    Running these two methods in succession should result in exactly the same
    model (or flow). This property can be used for unit testing (e.g., build a
    model with hyperparameters, make predictions on a task, serialize it to a flow,
    deserialize it back, make it predict on the same task, and check whether the
    predictions are exactly the same.)
    The example in the scikit-learn interface might seem daunting, but note that
    here some complicated design choices were made, that allow for all sorts of
    interesting research questions. It is probably good practice to start easy. 
  * :meth:`model_to_flow`: The inverse of :meth:`flow_to_model`. Serializes a 
    model into an OpenML Flow. The flow should preserve the class, the library
    version, and the tunable hyperparameters. 
  * :meth:`get_version_information`: Return a tuple with the version information
    of the important libraries. 
  * :meth:`create_setup_string`: No longer used, and will be deprecated soon. 
* Performing runs (required)
  * :meth:`is_estimator`: Gets as input a class, and checks whether it has the 
    status of estimator in the library (typically, whether it has a train method
    and a predict method).
  * :meth:`seed_model`: Sets a random seed to the model. 
  * :meth:`_run_model_on_fold`: One of the main requirements for a library to
    generate run objects for the OpenML server. Obtains a train split (with
    labels) and a test split (without labels) and the goal is to train a model
    on the train split and return the predictions on the test split. On top of
    the actual predictions, also the class probabilities should be determined. 
    For hard-classifiers, this can just be the hot-encoded predicted label. The
    predictions will be evaluated on the OpenML server. Also, additional
    information can be returned, for example, user-defined measures (such as
    runtime information, as this can not be inferred on the server). Additionally,
    information about a hyperparameter optimization trace can be provided. 
  * :meth:`obtain_parameter_values`: Obtains the hyperparameters of a given
    model and the current values. Please note that in the case of a hyperparameter
    optimization procedure (e.g., random search), you only should return the
    hyperparameters of this procedure (e.g., the hyperparameter grid, budget,
    etc) and that the chosen model will be inferred from the optimization trace. 
  * :meth:`check_if_model_fitted`: Check whether the train method of the model
    has been called (and as such, whether the predict method can be used).
* Hyperparameter optimization (optional)
  * :meth:`instantiate_model_from_hpo_class`: If a given run has recorded the
    hyperparameter optimization trace, then this method can be used to
    reinstantiate the model with hyperparameters of a given hyperparameter
    optimization iteration. Has some similarities with :meth:`flow_to_model` (as
    this method also sets the hyperparameters of a model). 
    


Hosting the library
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each extension created should be a stand-alone repository, compatible with the
`OpenML-Python repository <https://github.com/openml/openml-python>`_.
The extension repository should work off-the-shelf with *OpenML-Python* installed.

Create a `public Github repo <https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/create-a-repo>`_
with the following directory structure:

::

| [repo name]
|    |-- [extension name]
|    |    |-- __init__.py
|    |    |-- extension.py
|    |    |-- config.py (optionally)

Recommended
~~~~~~~~~~~
* Test cases to keep the extension up to date with the `openml-python` upstream changes.
* Documentation of the extension API, especially if any new functionality added to OpenML-Python's
  extension design.
* Examples to show how the new extension interfaces and works with OpenML-Python.
* Create a PR to add the new extension to the OpenML-Python API documentation.

Happy contributing!
