Contributing
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Contribution to the OpenML package is highly appreciated. Currently,
there is a lot of work left on implementing API calls,
testing them and providing examples to allow new users to easily use the
OpenML package. See the :ref:`progress` page for open tasks.

Please contact `Matthias <http://aad.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/people/feurer/index.html>`_
prior to start working on an issue or missing feature to avoid duplicate work
. Please check the current implementations of the API calls and the method
