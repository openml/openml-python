**Collaborative Machine Learning in Python**

Welcome to the documentation of the OpenML Python API, a connector to the
collaborative machine learning platform `OpenML.org <https://www.openml.org>`_.
The OpenML Python package allows to use datasets and tasks from OpenML together
with scikit-learn and share the results online.

-------
Example
-------

.. code:: python

    import openml
    from sklearn import preprocessing, tree, pipeline

    # Set the OpenML API Key which is required to upload your runs.
    # You can get your own API by signing up to OpenML.org.
    openml.config.apikey = 'ABC'

    # Define a scikit-learn classifier or pipeline
    clf = pipeline.Pipeline(
        steps=[
            ('imputer', preprocessing.Imputer()),
            ('estimator', tree.DecisionTreeClassifier())
        ]
    )
    # Download the OpenML task for the german credit card dataset with 10-fold
    # cross-validation.
    task = openml.tasks.get_task(31)
    # Run the scikit-learn model on the task (requires an API key).
    run = openml.runs.run_model_on_task(clf, task)
    # Publish the experiment on OpenML (optional, requires an API key).
    run.publish()
    print('View the run online: %s/run/%d' % (openml.config.server, run.run_id))

Contributing
------------

Contribution to the OpenML package is highly appreciated. The OpenML package
currently has a 1/4 position for the development and all help possible is
needed to extend and maintain the package, create new examples and improve
the usability. Please see the :ref:`contributing` page for more information.
