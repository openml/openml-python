**Collaborative Machine Learning in Python**

Welcome to the documentation of the OpenML Python API, a connector to the
collaborative machine learning platform `OpenML.org <https://www.openml.org>`_.
The OpenML Python package allows to use datasets and tasks from OpenML together
with scikit-learn and share the results online.

-------
Example
-------

.. code:: python

    import openml
    from sklearn import impute, tree, pipeline

    # Define a scikit-learn classifier or pipeline
    clf = pipeline.Pipeline(
        steps=[
            ('imputer', impute.SimpleImputer()),
            ('estimator', tree.DecisionTreeClassifier())
        ]
    )
    # Download the OpenML task for the german credit card dataset with 10-fold
    # cross-validation.
    task = openml.tasks.get_task(31)
    # Run the scikit-learn model on the task.
    run = openml.runs.run_model_on_task(clf, task)
    # Publish the experiment on OpenML (optional, requires an API key.
    # You can get your own API key by signing up to OpenML.org)
    run.publish()
    print(f'View the run online: {openml.config.server}/run/{run.run_id}')

You can find more examples in our `examples gallery <examples/index.html>`_.

Contributing
------------

Contribution to the OpenML package is highly appreciated. The OpenML package
currently has a 1/4 position for the development and all help possible is
needed to extend and maintain the package, create new examples and improve
the usability. Please see the :ref:`contributing` page for more information.
