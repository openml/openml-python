# ## 1. Obtaining a flow given a classifier

# %%
flow = openml.extensions.get_extension_by_model(clf).model_to_flow(clf).publish()
flow_id = flow.flow_id
print(flow_id)

# %% [markdown]
# This piece of code is rather involved. First, it retrieves a
# :class:`~openml.extensions.Extension` which is registered and can handle the given model,
# in our case it is :class:`openml.extensions.sklearn.SklearnExtension`. Second, the extension
# converts the classifier into an instance of :class:`openml.OpenMLFlow`. Third and finally,
# the publish method checks whether the current flow is already present on OpenML. If not,
# it uploads the flow, otherwise, it updates the current instance with all information computed
# by the server (which is obviously also done when uploading/publishing a flow).
#
# To simplify the usage we have created a helper function which automates all these steps:

# %%
flow_id = openml.flows.get_flow_id(model=clf)
print(flow_id)

# %% [markdown]
# ## 2. Obtaining a flow given its name
# The schema of a flow is given in XSD (
# [here](https://github.com/openml/OpenML/blob/master/openml_OS/views/pages/api_new/v1/xsd/openml.implementation.upload.xsd)).  # noqa E501
# Only two fields are required, a unique name, and an external version. While it should be pretty
# obvious why we need a name, the need for the additional external version information might not
# be immediately clear. However, this information is very important as it allows to have multiple
# flows with the same name for different versions of a software. This might be necessary if an
# algorithm or implementation introduces, renames or drop hyperparameters over time.

# %%
print(flow.name, flow.external_version)

# %% [markdown]
# The name and external version are automatically added to a flow when constructing it from a
# model. We can then use them to retrieve the flow id as follows:

# %%
flow_id = openml.flows.flow_exists(name=flow.name, external_version=flow.external_version)
print(flow_id)

# %% [markdown]
# We can also retrieve all flows for a given name:

# %%
flow_ids = openml.flows.get_flow_id(name=flow.name)
print(flow_ids)

# %% [markdown]
# This also works with the actual model (generalizing the first part of this example):

# %%
flow_ids = openml.flows.get_flow_id(model=clf, exact_version=False)
print(flow_ids)
