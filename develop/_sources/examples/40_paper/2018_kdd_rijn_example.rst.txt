van Rijn and Hutter (2018)
==========================

A tutorial on how to reproduce the paper *Hyperparameter Importance Across Datasets*.

This is a Unix-only tutorial, as the requirements can not be satisfied on a Windows machine (Untested on other
systems).

With the advent of automated machine learning, automated hyperparameter
optimization methods are by now routinely used in data mining. However, this
progress is not yet matched by equal progress on automatic analyses that
yield information beyond performance-optimizing hyperparameter settings.
In this example, we aim to answer the following two questions: Given an
algorithm, what are generally its most important hyperparameters?

This work is carried out on the OpenML-100 benchmark suite, which can be
obtained by ``openml.study.get_suite('OpenML100')``. In this example, we
conduct the experiment on the Support Vector Machine (``flow_id=7707``)
with specific kernel (we will perform a post-process filter operation for
this). We should set some other experimental parameters (number of results
per task, evaluation measure and the number of trees of the internal
functional Anova) before the fun can begin.

Note that we simplify the example in several ways:

1) We only consider numerical hyperparameters
2) We consider all hyperparameters that are numerical (in reality, some
   hyperparameters might be inactive (e.g., ``degree``) or irrelevant
   (e.g., ``random_state``)
3) We assume all hyperparameters to be on uniform scale

Any difference in conclusion between the actual paper and the presented
results is most likely due to one of these simplifications. For example,
the hyperparameter C looks rather insignificant, whereas it is quite
important when it is put on a log-scale. All these simplifications can be
addressed by defining a ConfigSpace. For a more elaborated example that uses
this, please see:
https://github.com/janvanrijn/openml-pimp/blob/d0a14f3eb480f2a90008889f00041bdccc7b9265/examples/plot/plot_fanova_aggregates.py # noqa F401

this data to make the Nemenyi plot, but this relies on the rather complex
``Orange`` dependency (``pip install Orange3``). For the complete example,
