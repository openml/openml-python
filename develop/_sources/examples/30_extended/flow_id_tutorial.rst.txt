==================
Obtaining Flow IDs
==================

This tutorial discusses different ways to obtain the ID of a flow in order to perform further
analysis.

1. Obtaining a flow given a classifier
======================================


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 33-38

.. code-block:: default


    flow = openml.extensions.get_extension_by_model(clf).model_to_flow(clf).publish()
    flow_id = flow.flow_id
    print(flow_id)

This piece of code is rather involved. First, it retrieves a
:class:`~openml.extensions.Extension` which is registered and can handle the given model,
in our case it is :class:`openml.extensions.sklearn.SklearnExtension`. Second, the extension
converts the classifier into an instance of :class:`openml.OpenMLFlow`. Third and finally,
the publish method checks whether the current flow is already present on OpenML. If not,
it uploads the flow, otherwise, it updates the current instance with all information computed
by the server (which is obviously also done when uploading/publishing a flow).

To simplify the usage we have created a helper function which automates all these steps:

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 48-52

.. code-block:: default


    flow_id = openml.flows.get_flow_id(model=clf)
    print(flow_id)

2. Obtaining a flow given its name
==================================
The schema of a flow is given in XSD (`here
<https://github.com/openml/OpenML/blob/master/openml_OS/views/pages/api_new/v1/xsd/openml.implementation.upload.xsd>`_).  # noqa E501
Only two fields are required, a unique name, and an external version. While it should be pretty
obvious why we need a name, the need for the additional external version information might not
be immediately clear. However, this information is very important as it allows to have multiple
flows with the same name for different versions of a software. This might be necessary if an
algorithm or implementation introduces, renames or drop hyperparameters over time.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 62-65

.. code-block:: default


    print(flow.name, flow.external_version)





.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

 .. code-block:: none

    sklearn.tree._classes.DecisionTreeClassifier openml==0.14.0dev,sklearn==1.2.2




.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 66-68

The name and external version are automatically added to a flow when constructing it from a
model. We can then use them to retrieve the flow id as follows:

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 68-72

.. code-block:: default


    flow_id = openml.flows.flow_exists(name=flow.name, external_version=flow.external_version)
    print(flow_id)





.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

 .. code-block:: none

    352




.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 73-74

We can also retrieve all flows for a given name:

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 74-77

.. code-block:: default

    flow_ids = openml.flows.get_flow_id(name=flow.name)
    print(flow_ids)





.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 78-79

This also works with the actual model (generalizing the first part of this example):

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 79-84

.. code-block:: default

    flow_ids = openml.flows.get_flow_id(model=clf, exact_version=False)
    print(flow_ids)

    openml.config.stop_using_configuration_for_example()
