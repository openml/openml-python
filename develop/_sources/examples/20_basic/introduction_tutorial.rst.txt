Setup
=====

An example how to set up OpenML-Python followed up by a simple example.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 8-18

OpenML is an online collaboration platform for machine learning which allows
you to:

* Find or share interesting, well-documented datasets
* Define research / modelling goals (tasks)
* Explore large amounts of machine learning algorithms, with APIs in Java, R, Python
* Log and share reproducible experiments, models, results
* Works seamlessly with scikit-learn and other libraries
* Large scale benchmarking, compare to state of the art

Installation
^^^^^^^^^^^^
Installation is done via ``pip``:

.. code:: bash

    pip install openml

For further information, please check out the installation guide at
https://openml.github.io/openml-python/master/contributing.html#installation

Authentication
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The OpenML server can only be accessed by users who have signed up on the
OpenML platform. If you don’t have an account yet, sign up now.
You will receive an API key, which will authenticate you to the server
and allow you to download and upload datasets, tasks, runs and flows.

* Create an OpenML account (free) on http://www.openml.org.
* After logging in, open your account page (avatar on the top right)
* Open 'Account Settings', then 'API authentication' to find your API key.

There are two ways to authenticate:

* Create a plain text file **~/.openml/config** with the line
  **'apikey=MYKEY'**, replacing **MYKEY** with your API key. The config
  file must be in the directory ~/.openml/config and exist prior to
  importing the openml module.
* Run the code below, replacing 'YOURKEY' with your API key.

.. warning:: This example uploads data. For that reason, this example
  connects to the test server instead. This prevents the live server from
  crowding with example datasets, tasks, studies, and so on.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 58-66

.. code-block:: default


    # License: BSD 3-Clause

    openml.config.start_using_configuration_for_example()








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 67-70

When using the main server instead, make sure your apikey is configured.
This can be done with the following line of code (uncomment it!).
Never share your apikey with others.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 70-73

.. code-block:: default


    # openml.config.apikey = 'YOURKEY'








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 74-85

Caching
^^^^^^^
When downloading datasets, tasks, runs and flows, they will be cached to
retrieve them without calling the server later. As with the API key,
the cache directory can be either specified through the config file or
through the API:

* Add the  line **cachedir = 'MYDIR'** to the config file, replacing
  'MYDIR' with the path to the cache directory. By default, OpenML
  will use **~/.openml/cache** as the cache directory.
* Run the code below, replacing 'YOURDIR' with the path to the cache directory.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 85-90

.. code-block:: default


    # Uncomment and set your OpenML cache directory
    # import os
    # openml.config.cache_directory = os.path.expanduser('YOURDIR')








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 91-94

Simple Example
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Download the OpenML task for the eeg-eye-state.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 94-104

.. code-block:: default

    task = openml.tasks.get_task(403)
    data = openml.datasets.get_dataset(task.dataset_id)
    clf = neighbors.KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors=5)
    run = openml.runs.run_model_on_task(clf, task, avoid_duplicate_runs=False)
    # Publish the experiment on OpenML (optional, requires an API key).
    # For this tutorial, our configuration publishes to the test server
    # as to not crowd the main server with runs created by examples.
    myrun = run.publish()
    print(f"kNN on {data.name}: http://test.openml.org/r/{myrun.run_id}")
