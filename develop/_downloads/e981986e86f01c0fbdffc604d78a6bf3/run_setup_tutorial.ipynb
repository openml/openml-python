        "\n# Run Setup\n\nBy: Jan N. van Rijn\n\nOne of the key features of the openml-python library is that is allows to\nreinstantiate flows with hyperparameter settings that were uploaded before.\nThis tutorial uses the concept of setups. Although setups are not extensively\ndescribed in the OpenML documentation (because most users will not directly\nuse them), they form a important concept within OpenML distinguishing between\nhyperparameter configurations.\nA setup is the combination of a flow with all its hyperparameters set.\n\nA key requirement for reinstantiating a flow is to have the same scikit-learn\nversion as the flow that was uploaded. However, this tutorial will upload the\nflow (that will later be reinstantiated) itself, so it can be ran with any\nscikit-learn version that is supported by this library. In this case, the\nrequirement of the corresponding scikit-learn versions is automatically met.\n\nIn this tutorial we will\n    1) Create a flow and use it to solve a task;\n    2) Download the flow, reinstantiate the model with same hyperparameters,\n       and solve the same task again;\n    3) We will verify that the obtained results are exactly the same.\n"
