        "With the advent of automated machine learning, automated hyperparameter\noptimization methods are by now routinely used in data mining. However, this\nprogress is not yet matched by equal progress on automatic analyses that\nyield information beyond performance-optimizing hyperparameter settings.\nIn this example, we aim to answer the following two questions: Given an\nalgorithm, what are generally its most important hyperparameters?\n\nThis work is carried out on the OpenML-100 benchmark suite, which can be\nobtained by ``openml.study.get_suite('OpenML100')``. In this example, we\nconduct the experiment on the Support Vector Machine (``flow_id=7707``)\nwith specific kernel (we will perform a post-process filter operation for\nthis). We should set some other experimental parameters (number of results\nper task, evaluation measure and the number of trees of the internal\nfunctional Anova) before the fun can begin.\n\nNote that we simplify the example in several ways:\n\n1) We only consider numerical hyperparameters\n2) We consider all hyperparameters that are numerical (in reality, some\n   hyperparameters might be inactive (e.g., ``degree``) or irrelevant\n   (e.g., ``random_state``)\n3) We assume all hyperparameters to be on uniform scale\n\nAny difference in conclusion between the actual paper and the presented\nresults is most likely due to one of these simplifications. For example,\nthe hyperparameter C looks rather insignificant, whereas it is quite\nimportant when it is put on a log-scale. All these simplifications can be\naddressed by defining a ConfigSpace. For a more elaborated example that uses\nthis, please see:\nhttps://github.com/janvanrijn/openml-pimp/blob/d0a14f3eb480f2a90008889f00041bdccc7b9265/examples/plot/plot_fanova_aggregates.py # noqa F401\n\n"
