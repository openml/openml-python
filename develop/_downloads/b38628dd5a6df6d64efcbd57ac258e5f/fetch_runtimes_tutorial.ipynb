        "\n# Measuring runtimes for Scikit-learn models\n\nThe runtime of machine learning models on specific datasets can be a deciding\nfactor on the choice of algorithms, especially for benchmarking and comparison\npurposes. OpenML's scikit-learn extension provides runtime data from runs of\nmodel fit and prediction on tasks or datasets, for both the CPU-clock as well\nas the actual wallclock-time incurred. The objective of this example is to\nillustrate how to retrieve such timing measures, and also offer some potential\nmeans of usage and interpretation of the same.\n\nIt should be noted that there are multiple levels at which parallelism can occur.\n\n* At the outermost level, OpenML tasks contain fixed data splits, on which the\n  defined model/flow is executed. Thus, a model can be fit on each OpenML dataset fold\n  in parallel using the `n_jobs` parameter to `run_model_on_task` or `run_flow_on_task`\n  (illustrated under Case 2 & 3 below).\n\n* The model/flow specified can also include scikit-learn models that perform their own\n  parallelization. For instance, by specifying `n_jobs` in a Random Forest model definition\n  (covered under Case 2 below).\n\n* The sklearn model can further be an HPO estimator and contain it's own parallelization.\n  If the base estimator used also supports `parallelization`, then there's at least a 2-level nested\n  definition for parallelization possible (covered under Case 3 below).\n\nWe shall cover these 5 representative scenarios for:\n\n* (Case 1) Retrieving runtimes for Random Forest training and prediction on each of the\n  cross-validation folds\n\n* (Case 2) Testing the above setting in a parallel setup and monitor the difference using\n  runtimes retrieved\n\n* (Case 3) Comparing RandomSearchCV and GridSearchCV on the above task based on runtimes\n\n* (Case 4) Running models that don't run in parallel or models which scikit-learn doesn't\n  parallelize\n\n* (Case 5) Running models that do not release the Python Global Interpreter Lock (GIL)\n"

        "## Summmary\nThe scikit-learn extension for OpenML-Python records model runtimes for the\nCPU-clock and the wall-clock times. The above examples illustrated how these\nrecorded runtimes can be extracted when using a scikit-learn model and under\nparallel setups too. To summarize, the scikit-learn extension measures the:\n\n* `CPU-time` & `wallclock-time` for the whole run\n\n  * A run here corresponds to a call to `run_model_on_task` or `run_flow_on_task`\n  * The recorded time is for the model fit for each of the outer-cross validations folds,\n    i.e., the OpenML data splits\n\n* Python's `time` module is used to compute the runtimes\n\n  * `CPU-time` is recorded using the responses of `time.process_time()`\n  * `wallclock-time` is recorded using the responses of `time.time()`\n\n* The timings recorded by OpenML per outer-cross validation fold is agnostic to\n  model parallelisation\n\n  * The wallclock times reported in Case 2 above highlights the speed-up on using `n_jobs=-1`\n    in comparison to `n_jobs=2`, since the timing recorded by OpenML is for the entire\n    `fit()` procedure, whereas the parallelisation is performed inside `fit()` by scikit-learn\n  * The CPU-time for models that are run in parallel can be difficult to interpret\n\n* `CPU-time` & `wallclock-time` for each search per outer fold in an HPO run\n\n  * Reports the total time for performing search on each of the OpenML data split, subsuming\n    any sort of parallelism that happened as part of the HPO estimator or the underlying\n    base estimator\n  * Also allows extraction of the `refit_time` that scikit-learn measures using `time.time()`\n    for retraining the model per outer fold, for the best found configuration\n\n* `CPU-time` & `wallclock-time` for models that scikit-learn doesn't parallelize\n\n  * Models like Decision Trees or naive Bayes don't parallelize and thus both the wallclock and\n    CPU times are similar in runtime for the OpenML call\n  * However, models implemented in Cython, such as the Decision Trees can release the GIL and\n    still run in parallel if a `threading` backend is used by joblib.\n  * Scikit-learn Neural Networks can undergo parallelization implicitly owing to thread-level\n    parallelism involved in the linear algebraic operations and thus the wallclock-time and\n    CPU-time can differ.\n\nBecause of all the cases mentioned above it is crucial to understand which case is triggered\nwhen reporting runtimes for scikit-learn models measured with OpenML-Python!\n\n"
