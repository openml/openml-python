        "Openml-python uses the [Python logging module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html)\nto provide users with log messages. Each log message is assigned a level of importance, see\nthe table in Python's logging tutorial\n[here](https://docs.python.org/3/howto/logging.html#when-to-use-logging).\n\nBy default, openml-python will print log messages of level `WARNING` and above to console.\nAll log messages (including `DEBUG` and `INFO`) are also saved in a file, which can be\nfound in your cache directory (see also the\n`sphx_glr_examples_20_basic_introduction_tutorial.py`).\nThese file logs are automatically deleted if needed, and use at most 2MB of space.\n\nIt is possible to configure what log levels to send to console and file.\nWhen downloading a dataset from OpenML, a `DEBUG`-level message is written:\n\n"
