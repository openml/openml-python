% % DEXTER is a text classification problem in a bag-of-word representation.
% % This is a two-class classification problem with sparse continuous input
% % variables. This dataset is one of five datasets of the NIPS 2003 feature
% % selection challenge.

% % Source:
% %
% % a.	Original owners
% % The original data set we used is a subset of the well-known Reuters text
% % categorization benchmark. The data was originally collected and labeled by
% % Carnegie Group, Inc. and Reuters, Ltd. in the course of developing the
% % CONSTRUE text categorization system. It is hosted by the UCI KDD repository:
% % http://kdd.ics.uci.edu/databases/reuters21578/reuters21578.html. David D.
% % Lewis is hosting valuable resources about this data (see
% % http://www.daviddlewis.com/resources/testcollections/reuters21578/). We used
% % the “corporate acquisition” text classification class pre-processed by
% % Thorsten Joachims <thorsten '@' joachims.org>. The data is one of the
% % examples of the software package SVM-Light., see
% % http://svmlight.joachims.org/. The example can be downloaded from
% % ftp://ftp-ai.cs.uni-dortmund.de/pub/Users/thorsten/svm_light/examples/example1.tar.gz.
% %
% % b.	Donor of database
% % This version of the database was prepared for the NIPS 2003 variable and feature selection benchmark by Isabelle Guyon, 955 %% Creston Road, Berkeley, CA 94708, USA (isabelle '@' clopinet.com).

% %
% % Data Set Information:
% %
% % The original data were formatted by Thorsten Joachims in the
% % “bag-of-words” representation. There were 9947 features (of which 2562
% % are always zeros for all the examples) representing frequencies of
% % occurrence of word stems in text. The task is to learn which Reuters
% % articles are about 'corporate acquisitions'. We added a number of distractor
% % feature called 'probes' having no predictive power. The order of the
% % features and patterns were randomized.

% %  This dataset is one of five datasets used in the NIPS 2003 feature selection challenge.
% %  Our website [Web Link] is still open for post-challenge submissions. Information about
% %  other related challenges are found at: [Web Link]. The CLOP package includes sample code
% %  to process these data: [Web Link].

% %  All details about the preparation of the data are found in our technical report: Design
% %  of experiments for the NIPS 2003 variable selection benchmark, Isabelle Guyon, July 2003,
% %  [Web Link] (also included in the dataset archive). Such information was made available
% %  only after the end of the challenge.
% %
% %  The data are split into training, validation, and test set. Target values are provided
% %  only for the 2 first sets. Test set performance results are obtained by submitting prediction
% %  results to: [Web Link].
% %
% %  The data are in the following format:
% %  dataname.param: Parameters and statistics about the data
% %  dataname.feat: Identities of the features (withheld, to avoid biasing feature selection).
% %  dataname_train.data: Training set (a coma delimited regular matrix, patterns in
% %	lines, features in columns).
% %  dataname_valid.data: Validation set.
% %  dataname_test.data: Test set.
% %  dataname_train.labels: Labels (truth values of the classes) for training examples.
% %  dataname_valid.labels: Validation set labels (withheld during the benchmark, but provided now).
% %  dataname_test.labels: Test set labels (withheld, so the data can still be use as a benchmark).
% %  Attribute Information:
% %  We do not provide attribute information to avoid biasing the feature selection process.
